            We work in small, focused teams. Every project starts with
            understanding — not assumptions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before design or code, we invest time in clarity: the problem,
            the context, and the constraints.
          </p>

          <p>
            We collaborate closely, communicate honestly, and move forward
            with intention. No unnecessary layers. No wasted motion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is not speed for its own sake, but progress that lasts.
